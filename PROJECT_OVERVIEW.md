# AzWrap Project Overview

## Introduction

AzWrap is a Python-based library that provides a high-level abstraction for interacting with various Azure services. It streamlines authentication, subscription management, resource group operations, storage management, blob handling, and integration with Azure Cognitive Search and AI services.

## Project Structure

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **.python-version**: Indicates the Python version used in the project.
- **main.py**: Serves as an entry point for application execution.
- **pyproject.toml**: Contains project configuration and dependency management details.
- **README.md**: General documentation for the project.

### AzWrap Folder

The `AzWrap` folder is the core of the project and encapsulates the main functionality and integrations with Azure services. It includes several modules:

- **__init__.py**: Marks the folder as a Python package.
- **cli_config.py**: Contains configuration settings for the command-line interface.
- **cli.py**: Implements the CLI interface for interacting with AzWrap.
- **main.py**: Provides the main execution logic for the application.
- **README.md**: Contains module-specific documentation.
- **wrapper.py**: The heart of the library, providing comprehensive wrappers around Azure services.

#### wrapper.py Details

The `wrapper.py` file implements several key classes to facilitate Azure operations:

- **Identity**  
  - Manages Azure authentication using either default credentials or service principal credentials.
  - Validates credentials by retrieving access tokens and initializes the subscription client.

- **Subscription**  
  - Represents an Azure subscription.
  - Provides methods to list and retrieve subscriptions, manage resource groups, and interface with storage and search services.

- **ResourceGroup**  
  - Handles operations related to Azure resource groups, including retrieving groups, listing resources, and creating search services or storage accounts.

- **StorageAccount**  
  - Encapsulates operations to manage Azure storage accounts.
  - Retrieves storage keys, constructs connection strings, and offers interfaces to manage blob containers.

- **BlobType (Enum)**  
  - Maps common file extensions to their corresponding MIME types.
  - Provides utility methods to derive blob types from extensions or MIME type strings.

- **Container**  
  - Manages Azure blob containers.
  - Offers functionalities to list blobs, retrieve blob content, and delete blobs.

- **Additional Classes**  
  - **SearchService, SearchIndexerManager, DataSourceConnection, Indexer, Skillset, SearchIndex, AIService,** and **OpenAIClient** integrate with Azure Cognitive Search and AI services.
  - These classes manage indexing, searching, data source connections, and interactions with OpenAI for generating text embeddings and chat completions.

The design of `wrapper.py` abstracts complex Azure SDK calls into intuitive, higher-level methods and incorporates retry mechanisms (via tenacity) to ensure robust operations.

## Additional Directories

- **docs/**: Contains detailed documentation divided into several parts that explain the usage and inner workings of the wrapper and related services.
- **test/**: Contains unit tests to validate functionalities such as identity management, blob operations, and search capabilities.

## Conclusion

AzWrap simplifies interactions with Azure by wrapping complex SDK functionalities into a user-friendly API. The cohesive structure within the `AzWrap` folder—particularly the comprehensive implementation in `wrapper.py`—provides a robust toolkit for managing Azure resources efficiently.
